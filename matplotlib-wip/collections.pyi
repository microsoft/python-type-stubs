class Collection(Artist, ScalarMappable):
    r"""
    Base class for Collections. Must be subclassed to be usable.

    A Collection represents a sequence of `.Patch`\es that can be drawn
    more efficiently together than individually. For example, when a single
    path is being drawn repeatedly at different offsets, the renderer can
    typically execute a ``draw_marker()`` call much more efficiently than a
    series of repeated calls to ``draw_path()`` with the offsets put in
    one-by-one.

    Most properties of a collection can be configured per-element. Therefore,
    Collections have "plural" versions of many of the properties of a `.Patch`
    (e.g. `.Collection.get_paths` instead of `.Patch.get_path`). Exceptions are
    the *zorder*, *hatch*, *pickradius*, *capstyle* and *joinstyle* properties,
    which can only be set globally for the whole collection.

    Besides these exceptions, all properties can be specified as single values
    (applying to all elements) or sequences of values. The property of the
    ``i``\th element of the collection is::

      prop[i % len(prop)]

    Each Collection can optionally be used as its own `.ScalarMappable` by
    passing the *norm* and *cmap* parameters to its constructor. If the
    Collection's `.ScalarMappable` matrix ``_A`` has been set (via a call
    to `.Collection.set_array`), then at draw time this internal scalar
    mappable will be used to set the ``facecolors`` and ``edgecolors``,
    ignoring those that were manually passed in.

        Parameters
        ----------
        edgecolors : color or list of colors, default: :rc:`patch.edgecolor`
            Edge color for each patch making up the collection. The special
            value 'face' can be passed to make the edgecolor match the
            facecolor.
        facecolors : color or list of colors, default: :rc:`patch.facecolor`
            Face color for each patch making up the collection.
        linewidths : float or list of floats, default: :rc:`patch.linewidth`
            Line width for each patch making up the collection.
        linestyles : str or tuple or list thereof, default: 'solid'
            Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted', '-',
            '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::

                (offset, onoffseq),

            where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink lengths
            in points. For examples, see
            :doc:`/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/linestyles`.
        capstyle : `.CapStyle`-like, default: :rc:`patch.capstyle`
            Style to use for capping lines for all paths in the collection.
            Allowed values are %(CapStyle)s.
        joinstyle : `.JoinStyle`-like, default: :rc:`patch.joinstyle`
            Style to use for joining lines for all paths in the collection.
            Allowed values are %(JoinStyle)s.
        antialiaseds : bool or list of bool, default: :rc:`patch.antialiased`
            Whether each patch in the collection should be drawn with
            antialiasing.
        offsets : (float, float) or list thereof, default: (0, 0)
            A vector by which to translate each patch after rendering (default
            is no translation). The translation is performed in screen (pixel)
            coordinates (i.e. after the Artist's transform is applied).
        offset_transform : `~.Transform`, default: `.IdentityTransform`
            A single transform which will be applied to each *offsets* vector
            before it is used.
        norm : `~.colors.Normalize`, optional
            Forwarded to `.ScalarMappable`. The default of
            ``None`` means that the first draw call will set ``vmin`` and
            ``vmax`` using the minimum and maximum values of the data.
        cmap : `~.colors.Colormap`, optional
            Forwarded to `.ScalarMappable`. The default of
            ``None`` will result in :rc:`image.cmap` being used.
        hatch : str, optional
            Hatching pattern to use in filled paths, if any. Valid strings are
            ['/', '\\', '|', '-', '+', 'x', 'o', 'O', '.', '*']. See
            :doc:`/gallery/shapes_and_collections/hatch_style_reference` for
            the meaning of each hatch type.
        pickradius : float, default: 5.0
            If ``pickradius <= 0``, then `.Collection.contains` will return
            ``True`` whenever the test point is inside of one of the polygons
            formed by the control points of a Path in the Collection. On the
            other hand, if it is greater than 0, then we instead check if the
            test point is contained in a stroke of width ``2*pickradius``
            following any of the Paths in the Collection.
        urls : list of str, default: None
            A URL for each patch to link to once drawn. Currently only works
            for the SVG backend. See :doc:`/gallery/misc/hyperlinks_sgskip` for
            examples.
        zorder : float, default: 1
            The drawing order, shared by all Patches in the Collection. See
            :doc:`/gallery/misc/zorder_demo` for all defaults and examples.

        Create legend handles and labels for a PathCollection.

        Each legend handle is a `.Line2D` representing the Path that was drawn,

        values passed to *c* as the labels.

        Also see the :ref:`automatedlegendcreation` example.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prop : {"colors", "sizes"}, default: "colors"
            If "colors", the legend handles will show the different colors of
            the collection. If "sizes", the legend will show the different
            sizes. To set both, use *kwargs* to directly edit the `.Line2D`
            properties.
        num : int, None, "auto" (default), array-like, or `~.ticker.Locator`
            Target number of elements to create.
            If None, use all unique elements of the mappable array. If an
            integer, target to use *num* elements in the normed range.
            If *"auto"*, try to determine which option better suits the nature
            of the data.
            The number of created elements may slightly deviate from *num* due
            to a `~.ticker.Locator` being used to find useful locations.
            If a list or array, use exactly those elements for the legend.
            Finally, a `~.ticker.Locator` can be provided.
        fmt : str, `~Formatter`, or None (default)
            The format or formatter to use for the labels. If a string must be
            a valid input for a `.StrMethodFormatter`. If None (the default),
            use a `.ScalarFormatter`.
        func : function, default: ``lambda x: x``
            Function to calculate the labels.  Often the size (or color)
            argument to `~.Axes.scatter` will have been pre-processed by the
            user using a function ``s = f(x)`` to make the markers visible;
            e.g. ``size = np.log10(x)``.  Providing the inverse of this
            function here allows that pre-processing to be inverted, so that
            the legend labels have the correct values; e.g. ``func = lambda
            x: 10**x``.
        **kwargs
            Allowed keyword arguments are *color* and *size*. E.g. it may be
            useful to set the color of the markers if *prop="sizes"* is used;
            similarly to set the size of the markers if *prop="colors"* is
            used. Any further parameters are passed onto the `.Line2D`
            instance. This may be useful to e.g. specify a different
            *markeredgecolor* or *alpha* for the legend handles.

        Returns
        -------
        handles : list of `.Line2D`
            Visual representation of each element of the legend.
        labels : list of str

            (m, n) -------- (m, n+1)

    The mesh need not be regular and the polygons need not be convex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : (M+1, N+1, 2) array-like
        The vertices. ``coordinates[m, n]`` specifies the (x, y) coordinates
        of vertex (m, n).

    antialiased : bool, default: True

    shading : {'flat', 'gouraud'}, default: 'flat'

    Notes
    -----
    Unlike other `.Collection`\s, the default *pickradius* of `.QuadMesh` is 0,
    i.e. `~.Artist.contains` checks whether the test point is within any of the
    mesh quadrilaterals.

    There exists a deprecated API version ``QuadMesh(M, N, coords)``, where
    the dimensions are given explicitly and ``coords`` is a (M*N, 2)
    array-like. This has been deprecated in Matplotlib 3.5. The following
    describes the semantics of this deprecated API.

    A quadrilateral mesh consists of a grid of vertices.
    The dimensions of this array are (*meshWidth* + 1, *meshHeight* + 1).
    Each vertex in the mesh has a different set of "mesh coordinates"
    representing its position in the topology of the mesh.
    For any values (*m*, *n*) such that 0 <= *m* <= *meshWidth*
    and 0 <= *n* <= *meshHeight*, the vertices at mesh coordinates
    (*m*, *n*), (*m*, *n* + 1), (*m* + 1, *n* + 1), and (*m* + 1, *n*)
    form one of the quadrilaterals in the mesh. There are thus
    (*meshWidth* * *meshHeight*) quadrilaterals in the mesh.  The mesh
    need not be regular and the polygons need not be convex.

    A quadrilateral mesh is represented by a (2 x ((*meshWidth* + 1) *
    (*meshHeight* + 1))) numpy array *coordinates*, where each row is
    the *x* and *y* coordinates of one of the vertices.  To define the
    function that maps from a data point to its corresponding color,
    use the :meth:`set_cmap` method.  Each of these arrays is indexed in
    row-major order by the mesh coordinates of the vertex (or the mesh
    coordinates of the lower left vertex, in the case of the colors).

    For example, the first entry in *coordinates* is the coordinates of the
    vertex at mesh coordinates (0, 0), then the one at (0, 1), then at (0, 2)
    .. (0, meshWidth), (1, 0), (1, 1), and so on.
