    exception will be raised.

def select_matching_signature(funcs, *args, **kwargs):
    """
    Select and call the function that accepts ``*args, **kwargs``.

    *funcs* is a list of functions which should not raise any exception (other
    than `TypeError` if the arguments passed do not match their signature).

    `select_matching_signature` tries to call each of the functions in *funcs*
    with ``*args, **kwargs`` (in the order in which they are given).  Calls
    that fail with a `TypeError` are silently skipped.  As soon as a call
    succeeds, `select_matching_signature` returns its return value.  If no
    function accepts ``*args, **kwargs``, then the `TypeError` raised by the
    last failing call is re-raised.

    Callers should normally make sure that any ``*args, **kwargs`` can only
    bind a single *func* (to avoid any ambiguity), although this is not checked
    by `select_matching_signature`.

    Notes
    -----
    `select_matching_signature` is intended to help implementing
    signature-overloaded functions.  In general, such functions should be
    avoided, except for back-compatibility concerns.  A typical use pattern is
    ::

        def my_func(*args, **kwargs):
            params = select_matching_signature(
                [lambda old1, old2: locals(), lambda new: locals()],
                *args, **kwargs)
            if "old1" in params:
                warn_deprecated(...)
                old1, old2 = params.values()  # note that locals() is ordered.
            else:
                new, = params.values()
            # do things with params

    which allows *my_func* to be called either with two parameters (*old1* and
    *old2*) or a single one (*new*).  Note that the new signature is given
    last, so that callers get a `TypeError` corresponding to the new signature
    if the arguments they passed in do not match any signature.
