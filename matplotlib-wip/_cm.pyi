def cubehelix(
    gamma: float = ..., s: float = ..., r: float = ..., h: float = ...
) -> Dict[str, partial]:
    """
    Return custom data dictionary of (r, g, b) conversion functions, which can
    be used with :func:`register_cmap`, for the cubehelix color scheme.

    Unlike most other color schemes cubehelix was designed by D.A. Green to
    be monotonically increasing in terms of perceived brightness.
    Also, when printed on a black and white postscript printer, the scheme
    results in a greyscale with monotonically increasing brightness.
    This color scheme is named cubehelix because the (r, g, b) values produced
    can be visualised as a squashed helix around the diagonal in the
    (r, g, b) color cube.

    For a unit color cube (i.e. 3D coordinates for (r, g, b) each in the
    range 0 to 1) the color scheme starts at (r, g, b) = (0, 0, 0), i.e. black,
    and finishes at (r, g, b) = (1, 1, 1), i.e. white. For some fraction *x*,
    between 0 and 1, the color is the corresponding grey value at that
    fraction along the black to white diagonal (x, x, x) plus a color
    element. This color element is calculated in a plane of constant
    perceived intensity and controlled by the following parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    gamma : float, default: 1
        Gamma factor emphasizing either low intensity values (gamma < 1), or
        high intensity values (gamma > 1).
    s : float, default: 0.5 (purple)
        The starting color.
    r : float, default: -1.5
        The number of r, g, b rotations in color that are made from the start
        to the end of the color scheme.  The default of -1.5 corresponds to ->
        B -> G -> R -> B.
    h : float, default: 1
        The hue, i.e. how saturated the colors are. If this parameter is zero
        then the color scheme is purely a greyscale.
