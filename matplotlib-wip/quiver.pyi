        Add a key to a quiver plot.

        The positioning of the key depends on *X*, *Y*, *coordinates*, and
        *labelpos*.  If *labelpos* is 'N' or 'S', *X*, *Y* give the position of
        the middle of the key arrow.  If *labelpos* is 'E', *X*, *Y* positions
        the head, and if *labelpos* is 'W', *X*, *Y* positions the tail; in
        either of these two cases, *X*, *Y* is somewhere in the middle of the
        arrow+label key object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        Q : `Quiver`
            A `.Quiver` object as returned by a call to `~.Axes.quiver()`.
        X, Y : float
            The location of the key.
        U : float
            The length of the key.
        label : str
            The key label (e.g., length and units of the key).
        angle : float, default: 0
            The angle of the key arrow, in degrees anti-clockwise from the
            x-axis.
        coordinates : {'axes', 'figure', 'data', 'inches'}, default: 'axes'
            Coordinate system and units for *X*, *Y*: 'axes' and 'figure' are
            normalized coordinate systems with (0, 0) in the lower left and
            (1, 1) in the upper right; 'data' are the axes data coordinates
            (used for the locations of the vectors in the quiver plot itself);
            'inches' is position in the figure in inches, with (0, 0) at the
            lower left corner.
        color : color
            Overrides face and edge colors from *Q*.
        labelpos : {'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'}
            Position the label above, below, to the right, to the left of the
            arrow, respectively.
        labelsep : float, default: 0.1
            Distance in inches between the arrow and the label.
        labelcolor : color, default: :rc:`text.color`
            Label color.
        fontproperties : dict, optional
            A dictionary with keyword arguments accepted by the
            `~FontProperties` initializer:
            *family*, *style*, *variant*, *size*, *weight*.
        **kwargs
            Any additional keyword arguments are used to override vector
            properties taken from *Q*.
