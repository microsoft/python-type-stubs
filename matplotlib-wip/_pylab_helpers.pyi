    Singleton to maintain the relation between figures and their managers, and
    keep track of and "active" figure and manager.

    The canvas of a figure created through pyplot is associated with a figure
    manager, which handles the interaction between the figure and the backend.
    pyplot keeps track of figure managers using an identifier, the "figure
    number" or "manager number" (which can actually be any hashable value);
    this number is available as the :attr:`number` attribute of the manager.

    This class is never instantiated; it consists of an `OrderedDict` mapping
    figure/manager numbers to managers, and a set of class methods that
    manipulate this `OrderedDict`.

        end.
