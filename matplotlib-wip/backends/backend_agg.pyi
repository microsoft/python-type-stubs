            used as appropriate:

            - Title: Short (one line) title or caption for image.
            - Author: Name of image's creator.
            - Description: Description of image (possibly long).
            - Copyright: Copyright notice.
            - Creation Time: Time of original image creation
              (usually RFC 1123 format).
            - Software: Software used to create the image.
            - Disclaimer: Legal disclaimer.
            - Warning: Warning of nature of content.
            - Source: Device used to create the image.
            - Comment: Miscellaneous comment;
              conversion from other image format.

            Other keywords may be invented for other purposes.

            If 'Software' is not given, an autogenerated value for Matplotlib
