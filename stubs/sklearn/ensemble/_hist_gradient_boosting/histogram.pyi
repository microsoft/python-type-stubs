class HistogramBuilder:
    """A Histogram builder... used to build histograms.
    A histogram is an array with n_bins entries of type HISTOGRAM_DTYPE. Each
    feature has its own histogram. A histogram contains the sum of gradients
    and hessians of all the samples belonging to each bin.
    There are different ways to build a histogram:
    - by subtraction: hist(child) = hist(parent) - hist(sibling)
    - from scratch. In this case we have routines that update the hessians
      or not (not useful when hessians are constant for some losses e.g.
      least squares). Also, there's a special case for the root which
      contains all the samples, leading to some possible optimizations.
      Overall all the implementations look the same, and are optimized for
      cache hit.
    Parameters
    ----------
    X_binned : ndarray of int, shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The binned input samples. Must be Fortran-aligned.
    n_bins : int
        The total number of bins, including the bin for missing values. Used
        to define the shape of the histograms.
    gradients : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
        The gradients of each training sample. Those are the gradients of the
        loss w.r.t the predictions, evaluated at iteration i - 1.
    hessians : ndarray, shape (n_samples,)
        The hessians of each training sample. Those are the hessians of the
        loss w.r.t the predictions, evaluated at iteration i - 1.
    hessians_are_constant : bool
        Whether hessians are constant.
